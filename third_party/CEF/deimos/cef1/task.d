// thread will be the same as the main application thread if cef_initialize() is
// called with a CefSettings.multi_threaded_message_loop value of false (0).)
// The IO thread is used for handling schema and network requests. The FILE
// thread is used for the application cache and other miscellaneous activities.
// This function will return true (1) if called on the specified thread.
